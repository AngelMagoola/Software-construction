UNDERSTANDING SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION AND COLLABORATION
### Question 1: Difference between programming and software construction(with example)
Programming the act of writing code so as to make a program to perform a certian task. It involves ensuring that code works correclty to produce the desired output<br>
On the other hand , software consturction is the detailed process of creating software covering aspects og coding, verification, testing and debugging.Well as programming can be done by an individual, software construction requires a collaborative team of members each handlding a specific task.<br>
#### One real world example
In our year 1 semester one, we were tasked to create a pseudo company website by our lecturer<br>
This project shows software construction because it involved more than just writing code. As a group, we planned the website, divided tasks, organized files and integrated everyone’s work into one system. We also tested pages and fixed issues so the site worked as a whole. This teamwork, planning and integration go beyond programming and reflect software construction.<br>
