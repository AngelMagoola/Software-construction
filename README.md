UNDERSTANDING SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION AND COLLABORATION
### Question 1: Difference between programming and software construction(with example)
Programming the act of writing code so as to make a program to perform a certian task. It involves ensuring that code works correclty to produce the desired output<br>
On the other hand , software consturction is the detailed process of creating software covering aspects of coding, verification, testing and debugging. Well as programming can be done by an individual, software construction requires a collaborative team of members each handlding a specific task.<br>
#### One real world example
In our year 1 semester one, we were tasked to create a pseudo company website by our lecturer<br>
This project shows software construction because it involved more than just writing code. As a group, we planned the website, divided tasks, organized files and integrated everyone’s work into one system. We also tested pages and fixed issues so the site worked as a whole. This teamwork, planning and integration go beyond programming and reflect software construction.<br>
### A situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems.
A situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems is in a hospital patient management system. Where if the system is poorly maintained, the code may be outdated, poorly documented and difficult to modify. So, when a developer tries to update the system like to add a new feature or fix a bug, they may accidentally introduce errors. This could lead to incorrect patient records, delayed access to test results or even wrong medication information being displayed. Such errors can directly affect patient treatment cause medical mistakes and put lives at risk. This shows that poor maintainability can have severe real-world consequences especially in critical systems like healthcare.
