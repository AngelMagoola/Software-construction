UNDERSTANDING SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION AND COLLABORATION
### Question 1: Difference between programming and software construction(with example)
Programming the act of writing code so as to make a program to perform a certian task. It involves ensuring that code works correclty to produce the desired output<br>
On the other hand , software consturction is the detailed process of creating software covering aspects of coding, verification, testing and debugging. Well as programming can be done by an individual, software construction requires a collaborative team of members each handlding a specific task.<br>
#### One real world example
In our year 1 semester one, we were tasked to create a pseudo company website by our lecturer<br>
This project shows software construction because it involved more than just writing code. As a group, we planned the website, divided tasks, organized files and integrated everyone’s work into one system. We also tested pages and fixed issues so the site worked as a whole. This teamwork, planning and integration go beyond programming and reflect software construction.<br>
### A situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems.
A situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems is in a hospital patient management system. Where if the system is poorly maintained, the code may be outdated, poorly documented and difficult to modify. So, when a developer tries to update the system like to add a new feature or fix a bug, they may accidentally introduce errors. This could lead to incorrect patient records, delayed access to test results or even wrong medication information being displayed. Such errors can directly affect patient treatment cause medical mistakes and put lives at risk. This shows that poor maintainability can have severe real-world consequences especially in critical systems like healthcare.


### Question 4:Describe how code reviews improve both software quality and developer's skill.
Code review is where code is scrutinized by fellow developers before it ever touches the main code base. This elevates both the product because it ensures that software is not just functional but also sustainable. These are some of the reasons:<br>
- There is faster Bug Detection in the code in the development process because when fresh eyes take a look at it, they easily notice the logical flaws the original author could have missed. This elevates the product by allowing developers to iron out those flaws therefore producing a sustainable product. <br>
- They ensure that the code is Consistent and Maintainable, in other words, the developers have to approve that the code follows the team’s style guide therefore making it much easier to maintain later. <br>
- Code reviews also spot out Security Vulnerabilities such as lack of input validation or insecure dependencies.<br>
#### Code reviews elevate the people behind it in various ways and some of them include;<br>
- Developers are exposed to new techniques that the original author might not have been aware of.<br>
- Developers improve on their communication when they are explaining the code they wrote and why they wrote it in that particular way.<br>
- When a developer is reviewing someone else’s code, they develop a “critical eye” for errors therefore helping them to recognize the flaws in their own work and in turn improve their own mistakes.<br>
